# LPC2148_ADC_UART_LCD_Interface
This project demonstrates interfacing of ADC with LPC2148 ARM7 microcontroller. It reads analog values via ADC, sends them over UART, and displays the result on a 16x2 LCD using 4-bit mode. Includes UART initialization, LCD control, and PLL configuration. Ideal for embedded systems learners.
